        <h1>Why I Chose Web Development and C++ DSA? </h1>
        <p>For me, I love things related to editing, creativity, and designing. Web development allows me to build 
            beautiful, interactive, and user-friendly websites. 
            I enjoy creating stunning UI/UX, animations, and well
            structured pages that enhance the user experience. 
            Seeing a well-designed site come to life in the browser gives me a sense of satisfaction and creativity. 
            The future is of AI and beautiful designs, and I love using AI. So by using AI, I will definitely bring new 
            creative ideas in tech. It is almost a fully computer-related task, and I have loved computers since childhood. 
            The bond between me and computers is unique. I never feel bored while doing any task on a computer, like 
            editing or coding. 
            It always gives new challenges to my mind, and I learn new things daily. </p>

        <h1>Why also DSA IN C++  with web dev.? </h1>
        <p>C++ is known for its speed, efficiency, and low-level memory control, making it the best choice for Data 
            Structures and Algorithms (DSA). DSA helps in improving problem-solving skills, and it is important for 
            coding interviews and competitive programming. 
            By mastering DSA, I will increase my problem-solving skills to a legend level. Mark Zuckerberg once said 
            that coding improves thinking power, and it takes our thinking to another level. 
            Mastering DSA in C++ also opens doors to big tech companies. In my college, only local-level companies 
            come and put DSA as a major criterion. So for this purpose also, and to strengthen my logical thinking and 
            optimization skills, I am learning C++ DSA. </p>

        <h1>Why Not Other Fields? </h1>
        <p>AI/ML, CS = I am more interested in designing and development rather than working on datasets and 
            models. In my college, AI/ML students are stuck, and the surrounding is important. 
            GATE= my core branch is ENTC , but from long years GATE was not my Aim ,  
            App Development = Web development feels more dynamic and visually engaging compared to mobile 
            apps. And I don’t like making apps. In fact, I also don’t like using mobile much, I mostly use my laptop. 
            Game Development = I have interest in gaming, and in childhood, I liked making games. But in foreign 
            countries like the USA, gaming is more developed than in India. Also, it requires deep graphics knowledge, 
            and I prefer working on real-world interactive websites. </p>

        <h1>Future Aim </h1>
        <p>My future aim is to become a Full-Stack Developer, like the GOAT (Greatest of All Time) in this field. I 
            want to master C++ DSA to crack top product-based companies and prove my skills and hard work 
            capability like Ronaldo shows in football.  
            I will also keep improving in UI/UX design to create visually appealing websites, in future, not thought so 
            much about that now,and in the future, I definitely want to learn and master UI/UX. 
            To achieve all this, I will build a strong portfolio that showcases my technical and creative abilities.  
            and also I will make website for our youtube news channel also, it will help a lot to improve and make 
            community strong and big. </p>
